# Chapter Title

### Opening vignette

Write a short, concrete story that puts the reader inside a familiar situation.  
Keep it specific, grounded, and free of analysis. Let the pattern emerge before you name it.

Use plain language. Avoid theory here.

---

## The principle

State the principle clearly and concisely.

Use **bold** for a single sentence definition that could stand alone as a quote.  
Follow with one or two supporting sentences if needed, but keep this section tight.

---

## Why it feels inevitable

Explain why this pattern shows up again and again.

Focus on:
- Human perception or behaviour
- Structural or systemic incentives
- Attention, pressure, fear, or convenience

Write in short paragraphs rather than bullets unless bullets genuinely add clarity.

---

## Real-world examples

Give several examples across different contexts to show the principle generalises.

Suggested mix:
- **Work / organisations**
- **Home / personal life**
- **Society / systems / culture**
- **Leadership or decision-making** (optional)

Each example should be brief and concrete, not hypothetical.

---

## How to spot it

List observable signals that indicate the principle is at play.

These should be things people actually say, do, or notice, for example:
- Language patterns
- Emotional reactions
- Decision shortcuts
- Metrics being over- or under-weighted

Bulleted list works well here.

---

## How to counter it

Describe practical ways to reduce the impact or respond more deliberately.

Focus on:
- Reframing
- Structural changes
- Measurement or visibility fixes
- Behavioural guardrails

Avoid “be better” advice. Aim for actions or design choices.

End with a short grounding sentence if helpful, clarifying that countering is not the same as eliminating.

---

## A reflective question

One question only.

It should:
- Invite reflection, not action planning
- Be applicable at work or in personal life
- Feel slightly uncomfortable but fair
