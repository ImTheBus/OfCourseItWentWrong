summary: When success becomes invisible and only failures generate attention, teams misread the situation and overreact.

### Vignette

A courier moves a million parcels a year. Almost all arrive without drama. The team hears about the rest.

### The principle

When a system works most of the time, success becomes background noise. Failures, complaints, and exceptions become the only visible evidence. The people closest to the problem start to believe the exceptions are the whole story.

### Why it feels inevitable

- Signals are biased toward friction: nobody logs “it was fine”.
- Attention is finite: you stare at the fires, not the empty field.
- Measurement often follows noise: the easiest data to collect is the thing that broke.

### Examples

- **Customer service:** calls cluster around defects, so the organisation feels broken even when defect rates are low.
- **Operations:** only damaged goods trigger investigation, so handling quality is inferred from a tiny sample.
- **Family life:** arguments are memorable, calm days disappear, and the relationship story becomes distorted.

### How to spot it

- You can list every failure from the past week, but not one success.
- The team talks like “everything is a mess” without using rates, denominators, or trends.
- Priority lists are entirely driven by complaints, not impact.

### How to counter it

- Track rates and volumes: “X out of Y” as standard language.
- Add a lightweight success signal: “no-issue” samples, spot checks, or quiet wins.
- Separate emotional load from system reality: support the team while still keeping the maths honest.

### Reflective question

What would you believe about this system if you saw the full dataset, not just the exceptions?
