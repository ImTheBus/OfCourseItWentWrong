### Vignette

Between 2015 and 2023, dozens of proposed onshore wind projects in England were blocked or abandoned.

Local objections were extensive and detailed. Planning records show concerns raised about landscape impact, noise, wildlife, traffic during construction, property values, and fairness to nearby residents.

Each objection was individually reasonable. Many were technically valid.

What was largely absent from consultations and hearings were statements like “we don’t want this area to change” or “we don’t understand what this would mean for us”.

Years later, reviews of the period noted that communities which blocked projects also missed out on cheaper local energy, community investment funds, and infrastructure upgrades that similar areas elsewhere received.

The objections succeeded.  
The benefits never arrived.

### The principle

**When people are uncomfortable with change but cannot safely say so, they oppose it through multiple reasonable objections that prevent progress without resolving the underlying discomfort.**

The objection is not aimed at improving the proposal.  
It is aimed at stopping movement.

### Why it feels inevitable

In most organisations and communities, saying “I don’t like change” is not seen as a legitimate argument.

It sounds selfish.  
It sounds uninformed.  
It sounds regressive.

But fear of change is common, especially when:
- Benefits are abstract or long-term
- Costs feel immediate or personal
- The change is imposed rather than co-created
- People feel talked at rather than involved

When that fear cannot be admitted, it looks for a more respectable outlet.

Environmental concern.  
Fairness.  
Risk.  
Precedent.  
Process.

These are not fake concerns. But they become **proxies** for something else.

### Real-world example: Onshore wind development in England (2015–2023)

In 2015, planning rules in England were changed so that onshore wind developments effectively required unanimous local support to proceed.

In practice, this meant that organised local objection could halt projects even when they met national policy goals and technical standards.

Planning inquiries and council records show objections commonly raised on:
- Visual impact
- Noise
- Wildlife
- Traffic
- Tourism
- House prices

Subsequent analysis by energy bodies and government reviews concluded that:
- Many blocked projects would have delivered local investment and community funds
- Areas that approved projects benefited from cheaper energy and infrastructure improvements
- National decarbonisation targets became harder and more expensive to meet

Importantly, later public consultation research found that opposition was often driven less by specific impacts and more by:
- Discomfort with unfamiliar infrastructure
- Lack of trust in decision-makers
- Feeling excluded from shaping outcomes

The objections were real.  
They were also doing more work than they admitted.

### How to spot it

Disingenuous objection of this kind often shows up as:

- A growing list of unrelated concerns
- Objections that persist even when mitigations are offered
- Movement of the goalposts rather than resolution
- Little engagement with potential upside
- Strong resistance paired with vague alternative proposals
- Statements framed as principle rather than preference

The common thread is not the content of the objection, but its effect: **nothing is allowed to change**.

### How to counter it

You cannot overcome this by answering objections one by one.

What helps instead:

- Making benefits concrete and local, not abstract
- Involving people early enough to shape outcomes
- Allowing people to express discomfort without judgement
- Naming trade-offs openly rather than pretending there are none
- Asking what would make the change acceptable, not just permissible

When people feel part of the solution, they stop needing objections as shields.

### Reflective question

Where in your organisation or community has progress stalled because people are arguing reasons instead of admitting discomfort with change?
