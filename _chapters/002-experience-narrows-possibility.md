# The Experience Trap

### Opening vignette

A team is asked to redesign how work flows through the business. They appoint someone who has been there for years. They know the systems, the people, and the history. The outcome is sensible and competent. The process looks almost the same, just slightly faster and slightly tidier.

Later, a similar problem is given to someone hired from outside. Their first questions are awkward. Why does this step exist at all? Why are these roles separate? Why does information move this way? The proposal feels unfamiliar and risky, but it removes entire problems the first redesign never touched.

Both projects succeed. Only one changes what the organisation believes is possible.

## The principle

**Past experience and past success narrow the set of futures we consider plausible.**

What has worked before quietly defines what feels sensible, realistic, and responsible, even when conditions have changed.

---

## Why it feels inevitable

Human judgement is built on pattern recognition. Experience trains us to notice what has mattered before and to ignore what did not. Over time, this creates efficiency, but it also creates blind spots.

Success strengthens the effect. When an approach has delivered good outcomes, questioning it feels irrational or even dangerous. The cost of being wrong appears higher than the cost of staying roughly the same, so alternatives stop being explored.

What began as learning hardens into a boundary.

## Real-world examples

**Work and organisations**  
Internal promotions often improve existing systems incrementally. People who know the organisation well tend to optimise what already exists. This works when the goal is reliability or scale. When the challenge is relevance or reinvention, it often results in the current model plus a small percentage.

External hires bring assumptions formed elsewhere. Practices that feel radical internally may feel obvious to someone without the same history. This can unlock new directions, but also introduces risk and discomfort.

**Home and personal life**  
People who have solved problems one way for years often struggle to imagine alternatives. A routine that once worked becomes the default, even when circumstances change. The habit persists because it feels proven, not because it is still appropriate.

**Society and systems**  
Industries frequently protect successful models long after their usefulness has declined. Regulations, standards, and professional norms reflect past success and make different futures harder to imagine, even when technology or behaviour has shifted.

## How to spot it

- Improvements are framed as small percentages rather than changed outcomes
- Radical ideas are dismissed early as unrealistic or irresponsible
- People say “we’ve tried that before” without checking whether conditions are the same
- Long tenure is treated as the primary qualification for future-facing work
- New hires are selected for how quickly they will fit existing ways of working

---

## How to counter it

- Match leadership choices to the type of problem, not to seniority or tenure
- Separate optimisation work from reinvention work and treat them differently
- Explicitly identify which constraints come from history rather than necessity
- Introduce external perspectives early, before solutions have solidified
- Protect naive questions instead of rewarding only confident answers

Experience should inform judgement, not define the limits of imagination.

## A reflective question

Where are you improving something because it is familiar, rather than because it is the best shape for what comes next?
