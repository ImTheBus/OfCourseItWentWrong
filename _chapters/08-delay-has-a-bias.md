## Delay Has a Bias  
*Waiting is rarely neutral and usually favours the status quo.*

### Vignette  
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Eastman Kodak repeatedly reviewed whether to shift decisively toward digital photography. The company had the technology. It employed the engineers who helped invent the digital camera. Market signals were visible and growing.

What followed was not refusal, but delay.

Committees commissioned further analysis. Pilots were run and extended. Decisions were deferred to protect existing revenue streams while “more data” was gathered. Each delay felt prudent. Each bought time.

During that time, competitors moved. Consumer behaviour shifted. By the time Kodak acted at scale, the market had already restructured around a different default.

The delay did not preserve neutrality. It actively favoured what already existed until it was no longer viable.

### The Principle  
Delay is often framed as caution, neutrality, or risk management.

In reality, delay almost always has a direction. By postponing change, decisions default to whatever is already in place. Existing processes continue. Incumbent advantages are preserved. Costs and risks accumulate quietly elsewhere.

Waiting is a choice with consequences, even when it feels like the absence of one.

### Why It Is Inevitable  
Delay feels safer than action. It spreads responsibility, avoids immediate conflict, and preserves optionality in the short term.

Organisations reward this behaviour unintentionally. Asking for more information sounds reasonable. Deferring decisions feels responsible. No one gets blamed for not acting quickly enough, especially when outcomes are uncertain.

The bias emerges because systems continue to operate while decisions are postponed. The status quo is not paused. It advances.

### How It Shows Up  
- Decisions deferred pending “one more review.”  
- Pilots that never conclude.  
- Temporary measures becoming permanent by default.  
- Known problems tolerated because change feels disruptive.  
- Risk framed only in terms of action, not inaction.

### Why It Causes Damage  
Delay compounds.

Opportunities decay. Options narrow. The cost of change increases as the environment moves on. When action finally becomes unavoidable, it is usually under worse conditions and with fewer degrees of freedom.

Because delay looks like caution, its consequences are often misattributed. Failure is blamed on complexity or timing rather than on the accumulated cost of waiting.

### Common Rationalisations  
- “We need more certainty.”  
- “Now isn’t the right moment.”  
- “Let’s see how this develops.”  
- “There’s no immediate harm in waiting.”  

Each sounds reasonable. Together, they explain how inaction becomes a strategy without ever being named as one.

### How to Counter It  
- Treat inaction as an explicit option with explicit costs.  
- Ask what the delay favours and who it benefits.  
- Set decision deadlines that force closure, not just discussion.  
- Distinguish between reversible and irreversible decisions.  
- Measure the cost of waiting, not just the risk of acting.

### What Good Looks Like  
Decisions that acknowledge time as an active force. Trade-offs made explicitly rather than by default. Situations where choosing not to act is recognised as a directional choice, not a neutral pause.

Delay still occurs, but its bias is understood and accounted for.

### Reflective Question  
What decision are you currently postponing, and what outcome does that delay quietly favour?
