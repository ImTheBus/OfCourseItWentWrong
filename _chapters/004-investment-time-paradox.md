### Vignette

The team is overloaded. Everyone agrees more help is needed.

A new hire has started, capable and keen. They sit nearby, waiting for direction.  
The manager means to train them properly, but today is already full. Orders need checking. A problem needs fixing. A meeting has overrun.

“I’ll walk you through it tomorrow.”

Tomorrow becomes next week. Next week becomes “when things calm down”.

The manager keeps doing the work themselves because it is faster. The new hire stays underused. The workload never reduces. The team remains busy enough to never stop being busy.

### The principle

**When time is scarce, systems defer investment in people and structure, even when that investment would quickly create more time.**

---

### Why it feels inevitable

Upfront investment has an immediate, visible cost.  
The benefit arrives later, spread out, and harder to measure.

Training someone takes time today. Delegation slows things down at first. Designing a process means stopping delivery briefly. Under pressure, those costs feel irresponsible, even when they are rational.

Short-term output is rewarded. Long-term capacity is assumed.

The system optimises for survival in the moment, not sustainability over time.

### Examples

- **Work:**  
  A manager continues handling complex tasks themselves because explaining them would take longer than just doing them. Months later, they are still overloaded and the team is still dependent.

- **Teams:**  
  A department delays onboarding properly because everyone is “too busy right now”. New hires take far longer to become effective, increasing the load on the rest of the team.

- **Operations:**  
  Manual processes persist because automating them requires design and testing time. The daily cost of manual work is accepted because it is familiar and immediate.

---

### How to spot it

- Training is always postponed until “things slow down”
- Leaders remain deeply embedded in operational tasks
- New roles exist on paper but not in practice
- Everyone agrees on what needs fixing, but no time is allocated to fix it
- The same pressure returns every week, unchanged

---

### How to counter it

- Treat capacity-building work as first-class delivery, not optional improvement
- Time-box onboarding and delegation, even if it feels inefficient initially
- Explicitly protect time for training, documentation, and handover
- Measure success by load removed over time, not speed in the moment
- Accept short-term slowdown as the price of long-term resilience

### Reflective question

What investment do you keep postponing because you are too busy, and how long has that busyness already cost you?
