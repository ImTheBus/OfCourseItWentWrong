## People Optimise for Survival  
*Most behaviour makes sense when viewed as self-preservation.*

### Vignette  
In NHS hospitals operating under the four-hour A&E waiting time target, staff were required to admit, discharge, or transfer patients within a fixed window. Missing the target triggered scrutiny, escalation, and reputational consequences for both individuals and organisations.

During periods of sustained pressure, a pattern emerged. Ambulances arriving at hospitals were asked to wait outside before formally handing patients over. Patients were moved to temporary holding areas shortly before the four-hour mark. Responsibility was reassigned between departments so the clock could be paused or reset.

None of these actions increased clinical capacity. They did not reduce demand or improve patient outcomes. They did, however, prevent breaches being recorded.

The staff involved were not trying to undermine the system. They were responding to targets they could not meet and consequences they could not absorb indefinitely. The system continued to function, but the information it produced became less reliable.

### The Principle  
When people feel under sustained threat, they optimise for survival.

Behaviour that looks obstructive, dishonest, or rule-breaking often becomes understandable when viewed through the lens of self-preservation. Immediate personal or organisational risk outweighs abstract goals, long-term outcomes, or the integrity of the system itself.

This does not require bad intent. It requires pressure without safe release.

### Why It Is Inevitable  
Organisations always create survival incentives, whether deliberately or not.

When missing a target carries clear consequences and meeting it feels unattainable, people adapt. When honesty exposes individuals to blame while compliance offers protection, behaviour shifts predictably. Rules are followed until they threaten survival, then they are bent or bypassed.

Under these conditions, people optimise not for the stated purpose of the system, but for staying employed, staying credible, or staying out of trouble.

### How It Shows Up  
- Targets met while underlying conditions worsen.  
- Workarounds becoming normalised practice.  
- Data adjusted to reduce scrutiny rather than reveal reality.  
- Problems contained locally instead of escalated systemically.  
- People privately acknowledging issues they cannot safely surface.

### Why It Causes Damage  
Survival-optimised behaviour corrodes systems from the inside.

Feedback loops break. Decision-makers lose visibility. Systems become increasingly blind to their own failure modes. By the time issues surface, they are structural rather than local and far harder to correct.

Attempts to restore control by tightening rules often intensify the problem. Fear increases. Survival behaviour accelerates.

### Common Misinterpretations  
- “People were breaking the rules.”  
- “This shows a lack of integrity.”  
- “They should have pushed back.”  

These explanations focus on individuals and miss the conditions that made rule-breaking the least harmful option available.

### How to Counter It  
- Make it safer to surface problems than to hide them.  
- Penalise concealment more consistently than failure.  
- Treat impossible targets as system design flaws, not personal ones.  
- Separate learning signals from disciplinary processes.  
- Regularly ask what behaviour your incentives are making rational.

### What Good Looks Like  
An environment where people do not have to choose between survival and honesty. Where breaking the rules is unnecessary because the rules acknowledge reality. Where systems surface stress early instead of forcing it underground.

People will always optimise for survival. Healthy systems ensure that survival aligns with truth rather than distortion.

### Reflective Question  
What behaviour in your organisation looks wrong until you ask what someone is trying to protect by acting that way?
