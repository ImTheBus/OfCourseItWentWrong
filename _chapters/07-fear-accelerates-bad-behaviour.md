## Fear Accelerates Bad Behaviour  
*Stress shortens thinking and sharpens selfish instincts.*

### Vignette  
In March 2020, supermarkets across the UK experienced sudden shortages of basic goods. Toilet paper, pasta, rice, flour, and cleaning products disappeared from shelves within hours of deliveries arriving.

There was no immediate supply failure. Warehouses still held stock. Logistics networks continued to operate. The problem was behavioural.

Shoppers began buying more than they needed, not because they planned to hoard, but because they were unsure what others would do. Seeing empty shelves reinforced the fear. Each person’s decision to take a little extra made the situation worse for the next person. Arguments broke out in aisles. Staff were shouted at. Some customers attempted to resell goods at inflated prices.

Most of the people involved were ordinarily considerate. The behaviour changed as fear took hold.

### The Principle  
Fear compresses thinking.

Under stress, people narrow their focus to immediate self-preservation. Long-term consequences, shared outcomes, and social norms lose priority. Behaviour becomes faster, simpler, and more self-directed.

This is not a character flaw. It is a predictable human response to perceived threat.

### Why It Is Inevitable  
Fear activates a short-term survival mode. Attention narrows. Cognitive load increases. The brain looks for quick certainty rather than careful judgement.

In this state, people rely on heuristics and visible cues. If shelves are empty, danger must be real. If others are taking more, taking more feels justified. Cooperative behaviour requires trust and time. Fear removes both.

Organisations often underestimate how quickly this shift happens. They assume that values, training, and norms will hold under pressure. In reality, fear can overwhelm them in minutes.

### How It Shows Up  
- People cutting corners to protect themselves.  
- Blame moving downward or outward rather than upward.  
- Information being withheld “just in case.”  
- Rules being applied selectively when they feel inconvenient.  
- Short-term wins pursued at the expense of collective outcomes.

### Why It Causes Damage  
Fear-driven behaviour is contagious.

Once people see others acting selfishly, they adjust their own behaviour to match. Trust erodes quickly. Systems that depend on cooperation start to fail, even if the original threat was manageable.

The damage is often blamed on bad actors. In reality, it is the acceleration of ordinary behaviour under stress that does the most harm.

### Common Misinterpretations  
- “People showed their true colours.”  
- “This revealed who can’t be trusted.”  
- “We need stricter rules.”  

These explanations miss the mechanism. Fear did not reveal new people. It changed the conditions under which existing people were operating.

### How to Counter It  
- Reduce uncertainty quickly and visibly.  
- Communicate early, even with imperfect information.  
- Make cooperative behaviour easy and selfish behaviour harder.  
- Protect those at the front line from becoming emotional shock absorbers.  
- Design systems that assume stress will degrade behaviour, not preserve it.

### What Good Looks Like  
Calm responses that slow decision-making rather than rushing it. Clear signals that reduce ambiguity. Structures that reinforce shared outcomes even when individuals feel threatened.

Fear still appears, but it does not set the pace.

### Reflective Question  
Where in your organisation does pressure currently reward speed or self-protection over judgement, and what behaviour does that accelerate when fear rises?
