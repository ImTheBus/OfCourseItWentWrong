## Parkinson’s Law  
*Work expands to fill the time and space available, regardless of actual need.*

### Vignette  
After independence, parts of the civil service in India saw a reduction in their original administrative workload. Fewer programmes were running. Fewer decisions genuinely needed to be made. The volume of external demand declined.

The organisation did not shrink.

Instead, internal activity increased. Committees multiplied. Subcommittees were formed to support them. Meetings generated agendas, which generated minutes, which generated action points, which generated follow-up meetings. Entire roles emerged to manage the coordination of work that no longer meaningfully existed.

Everyone was busy. No one was idle. The system grew, even as the work that justified its existence diminished.

### The Principle  
Parkinson’s Law is not a comment on laziness or people taking advantage. It describes how work naturally expands to occupy the time and space available to it, even when everyone involved is conscientious and genuinely trying.

When workload reduces but time, structure, and headcount remain unchanged, effort does not disappear. It redirects inward. Activity multiplies to fill the vacuum. Busyness becomes self-sustaining, even as value creation declines.

The failure is not effort. It is the loss of distinction between being busy and adding value.

### Why It Is Inevitable  
Organisations shape behaviour through their constraints, or lack of them.

When there is no external pressure to deliver outcomes quickly, internal processes become the work. Meetings exist because diaries are available. Papers are written because there is time to write them. Reviews are added because nothing yet forces a decision.

People respond rationally to the environment they are in. If diligence is measured by visible activity rather than outcomes, activity will expand to meet that expectation.

### How It Shows Up  
- A rising number of meetings despite a stable or shrinking workload.  
- Agendas, minutes, and action logs growing faster than delivery.  
- Decisions delayed by consultation that does not materially change the outcome.  
- Roles focused on managing coordination rather than producing results.  
- Progress existing primarily in documents rather than in reality.

### Why It Causes Damage  
The harm is not just inefficiency. It is distortion.

When busyness is mistaken for value, organisations lose the ability to tell whether they are effective. Resources are consumed maintaining internal motion. External impact slows, costs rise, and accountability becomes diffuse.

Over time, people become exhausted without feeling useful. The system demands more effort while delivering less meaning.

### Common Misdiagnoses  
- “The work is inherently complex.”  
- “We need stronger governance.”  
- “We need better reporting.”  

Often the real problem is not a lack of control, but an excess of time and space.

### How to Counter It  
- Treat meetings, committees, and reporting as costs that must earn their keep.  
- Define value explicitly in terms of outcomes, not activity.  
- Reduce timelines deliberately rather than letting urgency arrive by accident.  
- Remove work when demand falls instead of allowing it to turn inward.  
- Make it acceptable to conclude that some work no longer needs doing.

### What Good Looks Like  
Reduced demand leads to reduced activity, not internal expansion. People are busy because there is work to be done, not because the structure requires motion. Effort is proportional to value, and stopping work is recognised as progress.

### Reflective Question  
If external demand dropped by half tomorrow, what work would genuinely disappear, and what would quietly turn inward to fill the gap?
