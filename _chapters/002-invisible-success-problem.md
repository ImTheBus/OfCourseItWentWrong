# The Invisible Success Problem

A delivery company ships around a million parcels a year.

Almost all of them arrive on time, intact, and exactly as expected. No one emails to say so. No dashboards light up. No meetings are called. The parcels simply disappear into people’s lives, doing their job without comment.

Five thousand parcels do not.

They are late, damaged, lost, or delivered incorrectly. Each one generates at least one phone call. Often more. A customer service team handles around fifteen of these calls a day. Every call is frustrated, urgent, and specific. Each one feels like evidence of something going wrong.

Inside the customer service function, the picture is clear: deliveries are a problem. They are frequent. They are disruptive. They feel out of control. There is a growing sense that something fundamental is broken and that the business is at risk.

Nothing about this perception is dishonest. It is also wrong.

Five thousand failures out of a million deliveries is a 0.5 percent error rate. That rate may still be worth improving, but it is not a crisis. The system is not collapsing. It is largely working. The problem is not the performance. It is what is visible.

## The principle

**When success requires no attention, it disappears from perception, leaving failure to define reality.**

Systems that work quietly become invisible. Systems that fail loudly come to dominate how people understand what is happening, even when those failures are rare.

## Why it feels inevitable

Human perception is shaped by what passes in front of us.

People estimate scale from exposure, not from totals. When all of your input consists of exceptions, your mental model will always conclude that exceptions are the norm. This is not pessimism or incompetence. It is how attention works.

The effect is strongest in roles that are designed to handle problems. Customer service, compliance, safety, quality, risk, and escalation teams live entirely in the tail of the distribution. They never see the base rate. They only see what broke.

Without deliberate correction, their lived experience will always suggest that the system is failing, even when it is performing extremely well.

## Real-world examples

**Operational support teams**  
A support inbox contains only issues. Over time, staff begin to believe that issues are increasing, even when overall volume and error rates are stable or improving.

**Safety and incident reporting**  
An increase in near-miss reporting is interpreted as worsening safety, rather than improved transparency or awareness.

**IT reliability**  
Thousands of successful logins, transactions, and background processes go unnoticed. A handful of outages define the narrative of system stability.

**Leadership escalation**  
Senior leaders hear only what reaches escalation. By the time information reaches them, it is already filtered for urgency, risk, and failure.

## How to spot it

- Teams speak in absolute terms: “This is happening all the time.”
- People struggle to quantify scale without looking it up.
- Emotionally charged anecdotes substitute for data.
- Improvements go unrecognised, but problems linger in memory.
- The word “crisis” is used without reference to proportions.

---

## How to counter it

- Make success visible by design, not by accident.
- Always pair incident counts with total volume.
- Separate incident handling from system health discussions.
- Show trends, rates, and proportions, not just raw numbers.
- Actively remind teams what “normal” looks like.

This does not mean dismissing failures. It means placing them in context.

## A reflective question

Where in your organisation do people see only what went wrong, and what story would they tell if they could also see everything that quietly went right?
