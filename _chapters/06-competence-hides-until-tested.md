## Competence Hides Until Tested  
*Capability remains invisible until pressure forces it into view.*

### Vignette  
Before Flight 1549, Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger was an experienced but largely unremarkable commercial pilot. He had no reputation for drama or brilliance. He was known as reliable, methodical, and professional. Nothing about his routine performance distinguished him from thousands of others doing the same job competently every day.

Shortly after take-off from LaGuardia Airport in January 2009, the aircraft struck a flock of birds, disabling both engines. At low altitude over a densely populated city, there was no checklist that cleanly matched the situation and no time to follow one fully. The options were few, the information incomplete, and the margin for error almost nonexistent.

Under those conditions, Sullenberger made a series of rapid judgements. He assessed that returning to the airport was not viable, coordinated calmly with air traffic control, and executed a controlled landing on the Hudson River. All passengers and crew survived.

Subsequent investigation showed that many simulator-trained pilots, following standard procedures, were unable to achieve the same outcome when placed in the same scenario. The difference was not knowledge of the rules, but judgement under pressure. Until that moment, Sullenberger’s competence had not been visible. It had simply never been required.

### The Principle  
Competence is often inferred from performance in stable conditions rather than demonstrated through evidence.

When systems behave predictably and work follows known patterns, many differences in judgement, adaptability, and resilience remain hidden. People appear capable because the environment supports them. Processes absorb variation. Mistakes are caught early or compensated for by others.

When pressure removes that support, competence becomes observable.

### Why It Is Inevitable  
Most organisations are designed to reduce variability. Processes, checklists, and escalation paths exist to make outcomes reliable. This is necessary and effective.

It also means that individual capability is rarely tested. As long as conditions stay within expected bounds, people can perform adequately through habit, guidance, and the structure around them. Competence is inferred from proxies such as confidence, experience, fluency, or seniority.

Pressure changes the equation. Time compresses. Information becomes incomplete. Rules stop fitting cleanly. At that point, judgement and adaptability matter more than procedure.

### How It Shows Up  
- People who perform well in routine conditions struggling when plans break.  
- Others becoming unexpectedly decisive when discretion is required.  
- Increased escalation when independent judgement is needed.  
- Rigid adherence to process even as outcomes deteriorate.  
- Surprise, both positive and negative, at who copes when pressure rises.

### Why It Causes Damage  
When competence is assumed rather than tested, organisations place trust incorrectly.

Responsibility accumulates around those who look capable in calm conditions. When pressure eventually arrives, gaps are exposed at the worst possible moment, when the cost of failure is highest and the ability to recover is limited.

This also distorts development. People who have never been tested do not know their own limits. People who could handle more remain unseen because the system never required them to show it.

### Common Misjudgements  
- Confidence mistaken for judgement.  
- Experience mistaken for adaptability.  
- Seniority mistaken for decision-making under uncertainty.  
- Smooth delivery mistaken for resilience.

These signals correlate poorly with actual capability once conditions change.

### How to Counter It  
- Create deliberate, low-risk ways to test judgement before it is critical.  
- Use simulations, scenarios, or constrained problem-solving exercises.  
- Observe behaviour when information is incomplete and time is limited.  
- Reward sound decisions made under uncertainty, not just flawless routine execution.  
- Separate readiness for responsibility from success in stable environments.

### What Good Looks Like  
An organisation that understands the difference between reliability in calm conditions and competence under strain. Where people are tested early, safely, and intentionally. Where surprises about capability are rare because they have already been surfaced.

Competence is not assumed. It is observed.

### Reflective Question  
Whose capability in your organisation has only ever been inferred from calm conditions, and what risk does that create when pressure inevitably arrives?
