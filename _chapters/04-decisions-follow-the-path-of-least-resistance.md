## Decisions Follow the Path of Least Resistance  
*In the absence of challenge or clarity, decisions default to momentum, authority, or the fastest voices.*

### Vignette  
The question landed in the room and responses came quickly. A few people spoke almost immediately, confident and formed. Others stayed quiet, not because they had nothing to say, but because they were still processing.

The meeting moved on.

Later, in corridors and follow-up messages, the real concerns appeared. The risks were clear. The objections were thoughtful. They simply arrived too late to shape the decision.

No one acted in bad faith. The system moved faster than some people could think out loud.

### The Principle  
Decisions tend to follow the path of least resistance.

When there is no interruption, no challenge, or no explicit pause, momentum fills the gap. Authority, confidence, or speed becomes the deciding force. Silence is not neutrality in this context. It allows the easiest direction to win by default.

This is not a failure of intent. It is a predictable outcome of how groups move under time pressure.

### Why It Is Inevitable  
People think differently. Some process ideas rapidly and externally. Others need time, quiet, or reflection before forming a view. Both are normal.

Most group settings unintentionally reward speed. Meetings move on quickly. Silence is interpreted as agreement. Decisions are made before slower processors have had a chance to contribute.

There are also social dynamics at play. Speaking up can feel risky if the environment does not feel safe, if objections were previously dismissed, or if disagreement is treated as friction. In those conditions, resistance feels costly, and momentum feels easier.

### Silence, Clarified  
Silence in the moment is often appropriate.  
Saying “I need time to think about this” is responsible.  
Pausing before responding is not disengagement.

The problem arises when silence never resolves.

When people do not return with their concerns, do not state a position, or do not interrupt momentum at any point, decisions continue along the easiest available path.

### How It Shows Up  
- Decisions shaped primarily by the fastest or most confident voices.  
- Meetings that conclude with apparent agreement that later unravels.  
- Known risks discussed informally but never raised formally.  
- “No one objected” used as proof of alignment.  
- Surprise issues emerging late that were visible early.

### Why It Causes Damage  
When decisions follow least resistance rather than best judgement, quality degrades quietly.

Assumptions go untested. Risks compound. Commitments harden before dissent has a chance to surface. By the time objections appear, the cost of change is high and the appetite for reversal is low.

Over time, organisations drift toward decisions that are easy to make rather than right to make.

### Common Rationalisations  
- “I needed more time and never got it.”  
- “It didn’t feel safe to say.”  
- “They wouldn’t have listened anyway.”  
- “If I stayed quiet, it might just pass.”  

Each sounds reasonable on its own. Together, they explain why momentum goes unchallenged.

### How to Counter It  
- Normalise different thinking speeds and styles.  
- Make “I need time to think” an explicit and acceptable response.  
- Build deliberate pauses before decisions are finalised.  
- Follow up on silence rather than treating it as consent.  
- Reward considered resistance, not just rapid agreement.

### What Good Looks Like  
Decisions that allow space for both immediate reactions and considered responses. Meetings where silence is acknowledged and revisited, not ignored. Outcomes shaped by judgement rather than by default momentum.

Resistance becomes a constructive force, not a social risk.

### Reflective Question  
Where have you recently allowed a decision to follow the easiest path because resistance felt harder than silence?
